# Update # NOV 2025

## selfdriven Foundation

### # Catalyst Projects

> Several selfdriven-aligned proposals are in motion — connecting SSI, AI, and governance systems to real-world outcomes.

### # Websites — Actuate
> The family of selfdriven sites (**health**, **foundation**, **network**, **university**, etc.) are being aligned under the **Actuate** structure — simplifying access and purpose clarity.

### # AI — Diagrams & Frameworks
> Expanding our AI interface work — turning complex systems into **visual frameworks**, helping people and communities navigate change and decisions more clearly.

### # Handshake Integration
> We’ve secured the **.selfdriven** top-level domain on the **Handshake decentralised DNS** — an important step towards resilient, trustless naming for our ecosystem.

### # Summit Preparation
> Early work has started for a **selfdriven Reflect & Project** — bringing together communities.

### # Merch / Shop
> [shop.selfdriven.foundation](https://shop.selfdriven.foundation)

### # Tech / Human Interfaces
> We’re advancing work across the **Interface Stack** — from **WebAuthn** and **SSI logins** to **human-friendly dashboards**, all the way down to **core data protocols**.

## selfdriven Services

> Beyond all the research, frameworks, and multi-dimensional building — **selfdriven.services** is busy delivering real-world projects that connect purpose with practice.

### # Insurance (Private Pilot)

> We’re quietly operating a private-pilot insurance model built on SSI and trust frameworks — a proving ground for what community-anchored risk management looks like.

### # Health

> **selfdriven.health** is taking shape  — focused on member-based models for better health outcomes, powered by **beHub** and SSI integration.

### # BioHub

> The **BioHub** project continues momentum, tying regenerative practice to verifiable data and impact-linked rewards.

### # Unity Node — SDF Infra Interface

> The **Unity Node** infrastructure is live under the **selfdriven.foundation** banner — enabling community participation via rewards or donation routes.

> This forms part of the **Infra Interface** layer of **selfdriven.network**.

### # University Community of Practice

> The **University Community of Practice (CoP)** is growing, exploring how learning communities can self-actuate using the selfdriven framework and Cardano as a root of trust.
