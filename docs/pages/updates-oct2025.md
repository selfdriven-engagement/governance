# Update # OCT 2025

**We haven't done an update for a little while, so this one’s a catch-up!**

We plan to return to monthly updates and reflections.

---

## selfdriven Foundation
*Strengthening the foundations of the selfdriven ecosystem — frameworks, tools, and shared understanding for communities to self-actuate.*

### Actuate ("Onboarding")
*Helping communities begin their selfdriven journey with clarity and purpose.*

- A framework and set of resources to help communities progressively self-actuate and become self-driven.
    - [actuate.selfdriven.community](https://actuate.selfdriven.community)

### AI Diagrams & Frameworks
*Turning intelligence into insight — visualising systems to make complexity actionable.*

- Expanding our AI Interface work — turning complex systems into visual frameworks to help people and communities navigate change and decisions more clearly.
    - [selfdriven.ai](https://selfdriven.ai)

### selfdriven Get-Together — Cardano Summit, Berlin
*Connection and reflection as the selfdriven co-founders meet in person for the first time.*

- For the first time, four of the co-founders will be together in Berlin this November!  
- We’ll be attending the Cardano Summit and running the first *“selfdriven Reflect & Project”* session.  
- Early work has also started for a follow-up *“Reflect & Project”* gathering for all of the selfdriven community.  
- We look forward to catching up with many friends and collaborators at the Cardano Summit!

### Merch & Shop
*Extending our identity — wear the movement and share the message.*

- Based on our new branding, you can design and order your own merch using the instructions at [resources.selfdriven.foundation/merch](https://resources.selfdriven.foundation/merch/).  
- You can also purchase merch directly at [shop.selfdriven.foundation](https://shop.selfdriven.foundation).

### selfdriven.network 
*Building the digital backbone that connects people, data, and purpose.*

- **Interfaces**  
    - Foundational work continues to align all APIs into eight clean Interfaces.  
    - [selfdriven.network](https://selfdriven.network)

- **Handshake / .selfdriven**  
    - We’ve secured the **.selfdriven** top-level domain on the Handshake decentralised DNS — an important step towards resilient, trustless naming for our ecosystem.  
    - [selfdriven.network/infra-interface/handshake/](https://www.selfdriven.network/infra-interface/handshake/)

### Education
*Empowering lifelong learning through frameworks and accessible resources.*

- We’ve moved the selfdriven guides to [selfdriven.support/guides](https://selfdriven.support/guides).  
- This frees up [selfdriven.education](https://selfdriven.education) to host our educational frameworks and learning tools.

### Frameworks
*Designing mental models and organisational tools for self-actualisation.*

- We continue to develop frameworks that support the self-actualisation of individuals and their communities.
    - [AI Impact on Mind Framework](/impact-on-mind-framework/)  
    - [Situational Awareness Framework for Organisations](/situational-awareness-framework/organisations/)

### Research
*Grounding innovation in research — linking insight to impact.*

- All research work has been gathered at [research.selfdriven.foundation](https://research.selfdriven.foundation).  
- This will serve as a key input to the [selfdriven.institute](https://selfdriven.institute).

### Catalyst Projects
*Continuing our engagement with Cardano’s global innovation community.*

- We submitted several proposals in Cardano Catalyst Fund 14 — they received good support, but not enough for funding.  
- We’re now preparing two submissions for Fund 15, most likely **BioHub** and **BeHub** (as [selfdriven.health](https://selfdriven.health)).  
- [energy.selfdriven.foundation](https://energy.selfdriven.foundation)

## selfdriven Services
*Where purpose meets practice — bringing our frameworks to life through real-world delivery.*

**Beyond all the research, frameworks, and multidimensional building — [selfdriven.services](https://selfdriven.services) is busy delivering real-world projects that connect purpose with practice.**
 
### Insurance (Private Pilot)
*Proving new models of trust in the insurance ecosystem.*

- In collaboration with key insurance ecosystem stakeholders in Australia, we’re developing a private-pilot insurance platform built on SSI and trust frameworks — a proving ground for what community-anchored risk management can look like.

### Health
*Re-imagining health through membership, collaboration, and shared data.*

- [selfdriven.health](https://selfdriven.health) is taking shape — focused on member-based models for better health outcomes, powered by beHub and selfdriven.

### Community, Mallorca BioHub
*Growing regenerative practice through verifiable community action.*

- The BioHub project continues to gain momentum, linking regenerative practice with verifiable data and community development.  
- [actuate.selfdriven.community/use-cases](https://actuate.selfdriven.community/use-cases)

### Unity Node, Infra Interface, selfdriven.tel
*Expanding our infrastructure footprint and decentralised ownership model.*

- We’ve secured a Unity Node as part of [selfdriven.tel](https://www.selfdriven.tel/).  
- Ownership is communitised.  
- It will also present the first reward for holding [SDF Tokens](https://selfdriven.fyi/tokenomics) — more on this soon.
    - You can still obtain SDF tokens buy support the foundation by [buying Octo art](https://selfdriven.fyi/supporter).

### University Community of Practice
*Connecting educators and researchers around shared principles of Bildung.*

- The University Community of Practice (CoP) continues to grow.  
- [selfdriven.university](https://selfdriven.university) — join  
- [Bildung Presentation by Benjamin](https://www.selfdriven.education/resources/bildung/)
